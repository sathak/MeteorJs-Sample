## Installation

via npm:

    $ npm install simple-schema

## Usage

Property declarations can specify a property name or a path to a property using dot-notation (`nested.object.prop2`). If part of the path is an array - validator will treat the rest of the path as elements of objects in that array. E.g., `array.prop1` will validate property `prop1` on every object in array `array`. Nested array are supported as well.

Supported property options:

* `required`: _Boolean_ If this field is required
* `type`: _String, Array_ A lower*cased constructor name, 'null' and 'undefined'. Setting this property to an array of values will look for one of the values. Possible values are:
    - `object`
    - `regexp`
    - `array`
    - `function`
    - `string`
    - `number`
    - `date`
    - `boolean`
* `regexp`: _RegExp_ Regular expression to run on property value. Array of expressions is supported as well and validation will pass if at least one regular expression passes.
* `regexpAll`: _RegExp_ Regular expression to run on property value. Array of expressions is supported as well and validation will pass only if all expressions pass.
* `function`: _Function, String_ Function to run with `this` being the object and property name as first argument. This parameter can also be specified as a string if you want to point to a function in the global scope (defined as `global.fn = myFunc`)
* `min`, `max`: _Number_ Depending on property type these options can specify:
  * string length
  * numeric range
  * array length
* `error`: _Object_ Optional error properties. Validator does not use this property, it's purely for convenience.
  * `code`: _Any_ Error code
  * `message`: _Any_ Error message

Running validation returns an array of violated rules, as such:


```javascript
[
    {
        property: 'prop1',
        value: 'Value of prop1',
        rule: { /* rule as defined in the schema */ }
    }
]
```

 e.g. an empty array means success.

## Example
```javascript

var validate = require('simple-schema')
  , assert = require('assert')

var schema = {
  prop1: {
    required: true,
    type: 'string',
    error: {
      code: 'NOTASTRING',
      message: 'It is not a string'
    }
  },
  'nested.object.prop2': {
    required: false
  }
}

var myObject = {
  prop1: 'str',
  nested: {
    object: {} // missing prop2 here
  }
}

// validationResult will hold an array of violated rules or an empty array
var validationResult = validate(myObject, schema)
assert(validationResult.length === 0) // validation succeeded
```

## Tests

You need `mocha`.

    make test

You can check code coverage report by running

    make coverage
